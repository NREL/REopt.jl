# REopt速 Julia package
REopt.jl is the core module of the [REopt速 techno-economic decision support platform](https://www.nrel.gov/reopt/), developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). REopt速 stands for **R**enewable **E**nergy integration and **opt**imization. REopt.jl is used within the publicly-accessible and open-source [REopt API](https://github.com/NREL/REopt_API), and the publicly available [REopt Web Tool](https://reopt.nrel.gov/tool) calls the REopt API.

The REopt速 techno-economic decision support platform is used by researchers to optimize energy systems for buildings, campuses, communities, microgrids, and more. REopt identifies the optimal mix of renewable energy, conventional generation, storage, and electrification technologies to meet cost savings, resilience, emissions reductions, and energy performance goals.

For more information about REopt.jl please see the Julia documentation:

## Quick Start
Evaluating simple `PV` and `Storage` scenarios requires a linear program solver. Evaluating net-metering, generator, multiple outages, or other more complex scenario makes the problem mixed-integer linear, and thus requires a MILP solver. See https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/installation/ for a list of solvers. The REopt package has been tested with , `HiGHS`, `Cbc`, `SCIP`, `Xpress` (commercial), and `CPLEX` (commercial).

### Example
```
using REopt, JuMP, HiGHS

m = Model(HiGHS.Optimizer)
results = run_reopt(m, "pv_storage.json")
```
See the `test/scenarios` directory for examples of `scenario.json`.
