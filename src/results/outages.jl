!!! warn
	The output keys for "Outages" are subject to change.

!!! note 
	`Outage` results only added to results when multiple outages are modeled via the `ElectricUtility.outage_start_time_steps` and `ElectricUtility.outage_durations` inputs.
	
!!! warn
	The Outage results can be very large when many outages are modeled and can take a long time to generate.
