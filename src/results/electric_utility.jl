If include_exported_elec_emissions_in_total is False, this value only reflects grid purchaes. Otherwise, it accounts for emissions offset from any export to the grid.
- `avert_emissions_region` # EPA AVERT region of the site. Used for health-related emissions from grid electricity (populated if default emissions values are used) and climate emissions if "co2_from_avert" is set to true. 
- `distance_to_avert_emissions_region_meters` # Distance in meters from the site to the nearest AVERT emissions region.
- `cambium_emissions_region` # NREL Cambium region of the site. Used for climate-related emissions from grid electricity (populated only if default (Cambium) climate emissions values are used)

!!! note "'Series' and 'Annual' energy and emissions outputs are average annual"
	REopt performs load balances using average annual production values for technologies that include degradation. 
	Therefore, all timeseries (`_series`) and `annual_` results should be interpretted as energy and emissions outputs averaged over the analysis period. 

!!! note "Emissions outputs" 
    By default, REopt uses marginal emissions rates for grid-purchased electricity. Marginal emissions rates are most appropriate for reporting a change in emissions (avoided or increased) rather than emissions totals.
    It is therefore recommended that emissions results from REopt (using default marginal emissions rates) be reported as the difference in emissions between the optimized and BAU case.
    Note also that the annual_emissions metrics are average annual emissions over the analysis period, accounting for expected changes in future grid emissions.
