`ExistingChiller` is an optional REopt input with the following keys and default values:
```julia
    loads_kw_thermal::Vector{<:Real},
    cop::Union{Real, Nothing} = nothing,
    max_thermal_factor_on_peak_load::Real=1.25
    installed_cost_per_kw::Real = 0.0  # Represents needed CapEx in BAU, assuming net present value basis based on current size; also incurred in Optimal case if still using at all
    installed_cost_dollars::Real = 0.0  # Represents needed CapEx in BAU, assuming net present cost basis; also incurred in Optimal case if still using at all
    retire_in_optimal::Bool = false  # Do NOT use in the optimal case (still used in BAU)
```

!!! note "Max ExistingChiller size" 
    The maximum size [kW] of the `ExistingChiller` will be set based on the peak thermal load as follows, and
       this is really the **actual** estimated size of the existing chiller at the site:
    ```julia 
    max_kw = maximum(loads_kw_thermal) * max_thermal_factor_on_peak_load
    ```
