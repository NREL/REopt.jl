    Degradation

Inputs used when `ElectricStorage.model_degradation` is `true`:
```julia
Base.@kwdef mutable struct Degradation
    calendar_fade_coefficient::Real = 2.55E-03
    cycle_fade_coefficient::Real = 9.83E-05
    time_exponent::Real = 0.42
    installed_cost_per_kwh_declination_rate::Real = 0.05
    maintenance_strategy::String = "augmentation"  # one of ["augmentation", "replacement"]
    maintenance_cost_per_kwh::Vector{<:Real} = Real[]
end
```

None of the above values are required. If `ElectricStorage.model_degradation` is `true` then the 
defaults above are used. If the `maintenance_cost_per_kwh` is not provided then it is determined 
using the `ElectricStorage.installed_cost_per_kwh` and the `installed_cost_per_kwh_declination_rate` 
along with a present worth factor ``f`` to account for the present cost of buying a battery in the 
future. The present worth factor for each day is:

``
f(day) = \\frac{ (1-r_g)^\\frac{day}{365} } { (1+r_d)^\\frac{day}{365} }
``

where ``r_g`` = `installed_cost_per_kwh_declination_rate` and ``r_d`` = `p.s.financial.owner_discount_rate_fraction`.

Note this day-specific calculation of the present-worth factor accumulates differently from the annually updated discount
rate for other net-present value calculations in REopt, and has a higher effective discount rate as a result.  The present 
worth factor is used in the same manner irrespective of the `maintenance_strategy`.

!!! warn
    When modeling degradation the following ElectricStorage inputs are not used:
    - `replace_cost_per_kwh`
    - `battery_replacement_year`
    The are replaced by the `maintenance_cost_per_kwh` vector.
    Inverter replacement costs and inverter replacement year should still be used to model scheduled replacement of inverter.

!!! note
    When providing the `maintenance_cost_per_kwh` it must have a length equal to `Financial.analysis_years*365`-1.


# Battery State Of Health
The state of health [`SOH`] is a linear function of the daily average state of charge [`Eavg`] and
the daily equivalent full cycles [`EFC`]. The initial `SOH` is set to the optimal battery energy capacity 
(in kWh). The evolution of the `SOH` beyond the first day is:

``
SOH[d] = SOH[d-1] - h\\left(
    \\frac{1}{2} k_{cal} Eavg[d-1] / \\sqrt{d} + k_{cyc} EFC[d-1] \\quad \\forall d \\in \\{2\\dots D\\}
\\right)
``

where:
- ``k_{cal}`` is the `calendar_fade_coefficient`
- ``k_{cyc}`` is the `cycle_fade_coefficient`
- ``h`` is the hours per time step
- ``D`` is the total number of days, 365 * `analysis_years`

The `SOH` is used to determine the maintence cost of the storage system, which depends on the `maintenance_strategy`.

!!! note
    Battery degradation parameters are from based on laboratory aging data, and are expected to be reasonable only within 
    the range of conditions tested. Battery lifetime can vary widely from these estimates based on battery use and system design. 
    Battery cost estimates are based on domain expertise and published guidelines and are not to be taken as an indicator of real 
    system costs.

# Augmentation Maintenance Strategy
The augmentation maintenance strategy assumes that the battery energy capacity is maintained by replacing
degraded cells daily in terms of cost. Using the definition of the `SOH` above the maintenance cost is:

``
C_{\\text{aug}} = \\sum_{d \\in \\{2\\dots D\\}} C_{\\text{install}} f(day) \\left( SOH[d-1] - SOH[d] \\right)
``

where
- ``f(day)`` is the present worth factor of battery degradation costs as described above;
- ``C_{\\text{install}}`` is the `ElectricStorage.installed_cost_per_kwh`; and
- ``SOH[d-1] - SOH[d]`` is the incremental amount of battery capacity lost in a day.


The ``C_{\\text{aug}}`` is added to the objective function to be minimized with all other costs.

# Replacement Maintenance Strategy
Modeling the replacement maintenance strategy is more complex than the augmentation strategy.
Effectively the replacement strategy says that the battery has to be replaced once the `SOH` drops below 80%
of the optimal, purchased capacity. It is possible that multiple replacements (at same replacement frequency) could be required under
this strategy.

!!! warn
    The "replacement" maintenance strategy requires integer decision variables.
    Some solvers are slow with integer decision variables.

The replacement strategy cost is:

``
C_{\\text{repl}} = B_{\\text{kWh}} N_{\\text{repl}} f(d_{80}) C_{\\text{install}}
``

where:
- ``B_{\\text{kWh}}`` is the optimal battery capacity (`ElectricStorage.size_kwh` in the results dictionary);
- ``N_{\\text{repl}}`` is the number of battery replacments required (a function of the month in which the `SOH` falls below 80% of original capacity);
- ``f(d_{80})`` is the present worth factor at approximately the 15th day of the month in which the `SOH` falls below 80% of original capacity;
- ``C_{\\text{install}}`` is the `ElectricStorage.installed_cost_per_kwh`.
The ``C_{\\text{repl}}`` is added to the objective function to be minimized with all other costs.

## Battery residual value
Since the battery can be replaced one-to-many times under this strategy, battery residual value captures the \$ value of remaining battery life at end of analysis period.
For example if replacement happens in month 145, then assuming 25 year analysis period there will be 2 replacements (months 145 and 290). 
The last battery which was placed in service during month 290 only serves for 10 months (i.e. 6.89% of its expected life assuming 145 month replacement frequecy).
In this case, the battery has 93.1% of residual life remaining as useful life left after analysis period ends.
A residual value cost vector is created to hold this value for all months. Residual value is calculated as:

``
C_{\\text{residual}} = R f(d_{\\text{last}}) C_{\\text{install}}
``
where:
- ``R`` is the `residual_factor` which determines portion of battery life remaining at the end of the analysis period;
- ``f(d_{\\text{last}})`` is the present worth factor at approximately the 15th day of the last month in the analysis period;
- ``C_{\\text{install}}`` is the `ElectricStorage.installed_cost_per_kwh`.

The ``C_{\\text{residual}}`` is added to the objective function to be minimized with all other costs.

# Example of inputs
The following shows how one would use the degradation model in REopt via the [Scenario](@ref) inputs:
```javascript
{
    ...
    "ElectricStorage": {
        "installed_cost_per_kwh": 390,
        ...
        "model_degradation": true,
        "degradation": {
            "calendar_fade_coefficient": 2.86E-03,
            "cycle_fade_coefficient": 6.22E-05,
            "installed_cost_per_kwh_declination_rate": 0.06,
            "maintenance_strategy": "replacement",
            ...
        }
    },
    ...
}
```
Note that not all of the above inputs are necessary. When not providing `calendar_fade_coefficient` for example the default value will be used.
