Captures high-level inputs affecting the optimization.

`Settings` is an optional REopt input with the following keys and default values:

    add_soc_incentive::Bool = true # when true, an incentive is added to the model's objective function to keep the ElectricStorage SOC high
    off_grid_flag::Bool = false # true if modeling an off-grid system, not connected to bulk power system
    include_climate_in_objective::Bool = false # true if climate costs of emissions should be included in the model's objective function
    include_health_in_objective::Bool = false # true if health costs of emissions should be included in the model's objective function
