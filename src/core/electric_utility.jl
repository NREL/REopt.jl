```

!!! note "Outage modeling"
    # Indexing
    Outage indexing begins at 1 (not 0) and the outage is inclusive of the outage end time step. 
    For instance, to model a 3-hour outage from 12AM to 3AM on Jan 1, outage_start_time_step = 1 and outage_end_time_step = 3.
    To model a 1-hour outage from 6AM to 7AM on Jan 1, outage_start_time_step = 7 and outage_end_time_step = 7.

    # Can use either singular or multiple outage modeling inputs, not both
    Cannot supply singular outage_start(or end)_time_step and multiple outage_start_time_steps. Must use one or the other.

    # Using min_resil_time_steps to ensure critical load is met
    With multiple outage modeling, the model will choose to meet the critical loads only as cost-optimal. This trade-off depends on cost of not meeting load (see `Financial | value_of_lost_load_per_kwh`) 
    and the costs of meeting load, such as microgrid upgrade cost (see `Financial | microgrid_upgrade_cost_fraction`), fuel costs, and additional DER capacity. To ensure that REopt recommends a system that can meet 
    critical loads during a defined outage period, specify this duration using `Site | min_resil_time_steps`.

    # Outage costs will be included in NPV and LCC
    Note that when using multiple outage modeling, the expected outage cost will be included in the net present value and lifecycle cost calculations (for both the BAU and optimized case). 
    You can set `Financial | value_of_lost_load_per_kwh` to 0 to ignore these costs. However, doing so will remove incentive for the model to meet critical loads during outages, 
    and you should therefore consider also specifying `Site | min_resil_time_steps`. You can alternatively post-process results to remove `lifecycle_outage_cost` from the NPV and LCCs.

!!! note "Outages, Emissions, and Renewable Energy Calculations"
    If a single deterministic outage is modeled using outage_start_time_step and outage_end_time_step,
    emissions and renewable energy percentage calculations and constraints will factor in this outage.
    If stochastic outages are modeled using outage_start_time_steps, outage_durations, and outage_probabilities,
    emissions and renewable energy percentage calculations and constraints will not consider outages.
    
!!! note "MPC vs. Non-MPC"
    This constructor is intended to be used with latitude/longitude arguments provided for
    the non-MPC case and without latitude/longitude arguments provided for the MPC case.

!!! note "Climate and Health Emissions Modeling" 
    Climate and health-related emissions from grid electricity come from two different data sources and have different REopt inputs as described below. 

    **Climate Emissions**
    - For sites in the contiguous United States: 
        - Default climate-related emissions factors come from NREL's Cambium database (Current version: 2022)
            - By default, REopt uses *levelized long-run marginal emission rates for CO2-equivalent (CO2e) emissions* for the region in which the site is located. 
                By default, the emissions rates are levelized over the analysis period (e.g., from 2024 through 2048 for a 25-year analysis)
            - The inputs to the Cambium API request can be modified by the user based on emissions accounting needs (e.g., can change "lifetime" to 1 to analyze a single year's emissions)
            - Note for analysis periods extending beyond 2050: Values beyond 2050 are estimated with the 2050 values. Analysts are advised to use caution when selecting values that place significant weight on 2050 (e.g., greater than 50%)
        - Users can alternatively choose to use emissions factors from the EPA's AVERT by setting `co2_from_avert` to `true`
    - For Alaska and HI: Grid CO2e emissions rates for AK and HI come from the eGRID database. These are single values repeated throughout the year. The default annual emissions_factor_CO2_decrease_fraction will be applied to this rate to account for future greening of the grid.   
    - For sites outside of the United States: We currently do not have default grid emissions rates for sites outside of the U.S. For these sites, users must supply custom emissions factor series (e.g., emissions_factor_series_lb_CO2_per_kwh) and projected emissions decreases (e.g., emissions_factor_CO2_decrease_fraction). 

    **Health Emissions**
    - For sites in the contiguous United States: health-related emissions factors (PM2.5, SO2, and NOx) come from the EPA's AVERT database. 
    - The default `avert_emissions_region` input is determined by the site's latitude and longitude. 
    Alternatively, you may input the desired AVERT `avert_emissions_region`, which must be one of: 
    ["California", "Central", "Florida", "Mid-Atlantic", "Midwest", "Carolinas", "New England",
     "Northwest", "New York", "Rocky Mountains", "Southeast", "Southwest", "Tennessee", "Texas",
     "Alaska", "Hawaii (except Oahu)", "Hawaii (Oahu)"]
