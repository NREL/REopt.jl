For instance, to model a 3-hour outage from 12AM to 3AM on Jan 1, outagestarttimestep = 1 and outageendtimestep = 3. To model a 1-hour outage from 6AM to 7AM on Jan 1, outagestarttimestep = 7 and outageendtimestep = 7.Can use either singular or multiple outage modeling inputs, not bothCannot supply singular outagestart(or end)timestep and multiple outagestarttimesteps. Must use one or the other.Using minresiltime_steps to ensure critical load is metWith multiple outage modeling, the model will choose to meet the critical loads only as cost-optimal. This trade-off depends on cost of not meeting load (see Financial | value_of_lost_load_per_kwh)  and the costs of meeting load, such as microgrid upgrade cost (see Financial | microgrid_upgrade_cost_fraction), fuel costs, and additional DER capacity. To ensure that REopt recommends a system that can meet  critical loads during a defined outage period, specify this duration using Site | min_resil_time_steps.Outage costs will be included in NPV and LCCNote that when using multiple outage modeling, the expected outage cost will be included in the net present value and lifecycle cost calculations (for both the BAU and optimized case).  You can set Financial | value_of_lost_load_per_kwh to 0 to ignore these costs. However, doing so will remove incentive for the model to meet critical loads during outages,  and you should therefore consider also specifying Site | min_resil_time_steps. You can alternatively post-process results to remove lifecycle_outage_cost from the NPV and LCCs.\n\nnote: Outages, Emissions, and Renewable Energy Calculations\nIf a single deterministic outage is modeled using outagestarttimestep and outageendtimestep, emissions and renewable energy percentage calculations and constraints will factor in this outage. If stochastic outages are modeled using outagestarttimesteps, outagedurations, and outage_probabilities, emissions and renewable energy percentage calculations and constraints will not consider outages.\n\nnote: MPC vs. Non-MPC\nThis constructor is intended to be used with latitude/longitude arguments provided for the non-MPC case and without latitude/longitude arguments provided for the MPC case.\n\nnote: Climate and Health Emissions and Grid Clean Energy Modeling\nClimate and health-related emissions from grid electricity come from two different data sources and have different REopt inputs as described below. Climate EmissionsFor sites in the contiguous United States (CONUS): \nDefault climate-related emissions factors come from NREL's Cambium database (Current version: 2022)\nBy default, REopt uses levelized long-run marginal emission rates for CO2-equivalent (CO2e) emissions for the region in which the site is located.    By default, the emissions rates are levelized over the analysis period (e.g., from 2025 through 2049 for a 25-year analysis)\nThe inputs to the Cambium API request can be modified by the user based on emissions accounting needs (e.g., can change \"lifetime\" to 1 to analyze a single year's emissions)\nNote for analysis periods extending beyond 2050: Values beyond 2050 are estimated with the 2050 values. Analysts are advised to use caution when selecting values that place significant weight on 2050 (e.g., greater than 50%)\nUsers can alternatively choose to use emissions factors from the EPA's AVERT by setting co2_from_avert to true\nFor Alaska and HI: Grid CO2e emissions rates come from the eGRID database. These are single values repeated throughout the year. The default annual emissions_factor_CO2_decrease_fraction will be applied to this rate to account for future greening of the grid.   \nFor sites outside of the United States: REopt does not have default grid emissions rates for sites outside of the U.S. For these sites, users must supply custom emissions factor series (emissions_factor_series_lb_CO2_per_kwh) and projected emissions decreases (emissions_factor_CO2_decrease_fraction). Health EmissionsFor sites in CONUS: health-related emissions factors (PM2.5, SO2, and NOx) come from the EPA's AVERT database.\nFor Alaska and HI: Grid health emissions rates come from the eGRID database. These are single values repeated throughout the year. The default annual emissions_factor_XXX_decrease_fraction will be applied to this rate to account for future greening of the grid. \nThe default avert_emissions_region input is determined by the site's latitude and longitude. Alternatively, you may input the desired AVERT avert_emissions_region, which must be one of:  [\"California\", \"Central\", \"Florida\", \"Mid-Atlantic\", \"Midwest\", \"Carolinas\", \"New England\",\"Northwest\", \"New York\", \"Rocky Mountains\", \"Southeast\", \"Southwest\", \"Tennessee\", \"Texas\", \"Alaska\", \"Hawaii (except Oahu)\", \"Hawaii (Oahu)\"]For sites outside of the United States: REopt does not have default grid emissions rates for sites outside of the U.S. For these sites, users must supply custom emissions factor series (e.g., emissions_factor_series_lb_NOx_per_kwh) and projected emissions decreases (e.g., emissions_factor_NOx_decrease_fraction). Grid Clean Energy FractionFor sites in CONUS: \nDefault clean energy fraction data comes from NREL's Cambium database (Current version: 2022)\nBy default, REopt uses clean energy fraction for the region in which the site is located.\nFor sites outside of CONUS: REopt does not have default grid clean energy fraction data. Users must supply a custom renewable_energy_fraction_series\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"reopt/inputs/#PV","page":"REopt Inputs","title":"PV","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"reopt/inputs/","page":"REopt Inputs","title":"REopt Inputs","text":"REopt.PV","category":"page"},{"location":"reopt/inputs/#REopt.PV","page":"REopt Inputs","title":"REopt.PV","text":"PV is an optional REopt input with the following keys and default values:\n\n    array_type::Int=1, # PV Watts array type (0: Ground Mount Fixed (Open Rack); 1: Rooftop, Fixed; 2: Ground Mount 1-Axis Tracking; 3 : 1-Axis Backtracking; 4: Ground Mount, 2-Axis Tracking)\n    tilt::Real = (array_type == 0 || array_type == 1) ? 20 : 0, # tilt = 20 for fixed rooftop arrays (1) or ground-mount (2) ; tilt = 0 for everything else (3 and 4)\n    module_type::Int=0, # PV module type (0: Standard; 1: Premium; 2: Thin Film)\n    losses::Real=0.14, # System losses\n    azimuth::Real = latitude≥0 ? 180 : 0, # set azimuth to zero for southern hemisphere\n    gcr::Real=0.4,  # Ground coverage ratio\n    radius::Int=0, # Radius, in miles, to use when searching for the closest climate data station.

Inverter replacement costs and inverter replacement year should still be used to model scheduled replacement of inverter.\n\nnote: Note\nWhen providing the maintenance_cost_per_kwh it must have a length equal to Financial.analysis_years*365-1.\n\nBattery State Of Health\n\nThe state of health [SOH] is a linear function of the daily average state of charge [Eavg] and the daily equivalent full cycles [EFC]. The initial SOH is set to the optimal battery energy capacity  (in kWh). The evolution of the SOH beyond the first day is:\n\nSOHd = SOHd-1 - hleft(     frac12 k_cal Eavgd-1  sqrtd + k_cyc EFCd-1 quad forall d in 2dots D right)\n\nwhere:\n\nk_cal is the calendar_fade_coefficient\nk_cyc is the cycle_fade_coefficient\nh is the hours per time step\nD is the total number of days, 365 * analysis_years\n\nThe SOH is used to determine the maintence cost of the storage system, which depends on the maintenance_strategy.\n\nnote: Note\nBattery degradation parameters are from based on laboratory aging data, and are expected to be reasonable only within  the range of conditions tested. Battery lifetime can vary widely from these estimates based on battery use and system design.  Battery cost estimates are based on domain expertise and published guidelines and are not to be taken as an indicator of real  system costs.\n\nAugmentation Maintenance Strategy\n\nThe augmentation maintenance strategy assumes that the battery energy capacity is maintained by replacing degraded cells daily in terms of cost. Using the definition of the SOH above the maintenance cost is:\n\nC_textaug = sum_d in 2dots D C_textinstall f(day) left( SOHd-1 - SOHd right)\n\nwhere\n\nf(day) is the present worth factor of battery degradation costs as described above;\nC_textinstall is the ElectricStorage.installed_cost_per_kwh; and\nSOHd-1 - SOHd is the incremental amount of battery capacity lost in a day.\n\nThe C_textaug is added to the objective function to be minimized with all other costs.\n\nReplacement Maintenance Strategy\n\nModeling the replacement maintenance strategy is more complex than the augmentation strategy. Effectively the replacement strategy says that the battery has to be replaced once the SOH drops below 80% of the optimal, purchased capacity. It is possible that multiple replacements (at same replacement frequency) could be required under this strategy.\n\nwarn: Warn\nThe \"replacement\" maintenance strategy requires integer decision variables. Some solvers are slow with integer decision variables.\n\nThe replacement strategy cost is:\n\nC_textrepl = B_textkWh N_textrepl f(d_80) C_textinstall\n\nwhere:\n\nB_textkWh is the optimal battery capacity (ElectricStorage.size_kwh in the results dictionary);\nN_textrepl is the number of battery replacments required (a function of the month in which the SOH falls below 80% of original capacity);\nf(d_80) is the present worth factor at approximately the 15th day of the month in which the SOH falls below 80% of original capacity;\nC_textinstall is the ElectricStorage.installed_cost_per_kwh.\n\nThe C_textrepl is added to the objective function to be minimized with all other costs.\n\nBattery residual value\n\nSince the battery can be replaced one-to-many times under this strategy, battery residual value captures the $ value of remaining battery life at end of analysis period. For example if replacement happens in month 145, then assuming 25 year analysis period there will be 2 replacements (months 145 and 290).  The last battery which was placed in service during month 290 only serves for 10 months (i.e. 6.89% of its expected life assuming 145 month replacement frequecy). In this case, the battery has 93.1% of residual life remaining as useful life left after analysis period ends. A residual value cost vector is created to hold this value for all months. Residual value is calculated as:\n\nC_textresidual = R f(d_textlast) C_textinstall where:\n\nR is the residual_factor which determines portion of battery life remaining at the end of the analysis period;\nf(d_textlast) is the present worth factor at approximately the 15th day of the last month in the analysis period;\nC_textinstall is the ElectricStorage.installed_cost_per_kwh.\n\nThe C_textresidual is added to the objective function to be minimized with all other costs.\n\nExample of inputs\n\nThe following shows how one would use the degradation model in REopt via the Scenario inputs:\n\n{\n    ...\n    \"ElectricStorage\": {\n        \"installed_cost_per_kwh\": 390,\n        ...\n        \"model_degradation\": true,\n        \"degradation\": {\n            \"calendar_fade_coefficient\": 1.16E-03,\n            \"cycle_fade_coefficient\": [2.46E-05],\n            \"cycle_fade_fraction\": [1.0],\n            \"time_exponent\": 0.428\n            \"installed_cost_per_kwh_declination_rate\": 0.05,\n            \"maintenance_strategy\": \"replacement\",\n            ...\n        }\n    },\n    ...\n}\n\nNote that not all of the above inputs are necessary.
